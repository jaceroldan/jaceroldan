## Hi there! 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Multimodal Deep Learning research at the University of the Philippines Diliman as a graduate student at UPD's Artificial Intelligence Program.  I am also currently an AI Engineering lead at Scalema.com! My current projects involve building various co-pilots to assist in many professional tasks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot modern NLP concepts and practicing a lot of my MLOps skills while completing my graduate program. I'm looking to integrate the concept of "memory" in conversational agents to improve its ability to converse without falling flat.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything NLP! I've built quite a few RAG systems and chatbots and would like to expand my horizons in this regard. I am also currently dabbling in multi-modal foundation model space... text, speech, vision, video — you name it.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with advancing machine learning past Type 1 capabilities. I'm heavily looking into concepts like the application of deep learning into reasoning, abstraction, and AGI.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to deep learning and natural language processing concepts! I'm also an avid programmer and constantly looking to improve my skills in Python, JavaScript, and C and get to learn new performant languages like Rust.
- 📫 How to reach me: For academic things, my university email is jtroldan@up.edu.ph! My professional email is jaceroldan16@gmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love playing StarCraft 2, and though I might not really be that good at it, one of the items in my bucket list is to be able to build a win-prediction model for StarCraft 2 matches.
