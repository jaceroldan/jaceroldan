## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jaceroldan/jaceroldan** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Multimodal Deep Learning research at the University of the Philippines Diliman as a graduate student at UPD's Artificial Intelligence Program.  I am also currently an AI Engineering lead at Scalema.com! My current projects involve building various co-pilots to assist in many professional tasks.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot modern NLP concepts and practicing a lot of my MLOps skills while completing my graduate program. I'm looking to integrate the concept of "memory" in conversational agents to improve its ability to converse without falling flat.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything NLP! I've built quite a few RAG systems and chatbots and would like to expand my horizons in this regard. I am also currently dabbling in multi-modal foundation model space... text, speech, vision, video â€”Â you name it.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advancing machine learning past Type 1 capabilities. I'm heavily looking into concepts like the application of deep learning into reasoning, abstraction, and AGI.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to deep learning and natural language processing concepts! I'm also an avid programmer and constantly looking to improve my skills in Python, JavaScript, and C and get to learn new performant languages like Rust.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: For academic things, my university email is jtroldan@up.edu.ph! My professional email is jaceroldan16@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing StarCraft 2, and though I might not really be that good at it, one of the items in my bucket list is to be able to build a win-prediction model for StarCraft 2 matches.
